# Introduction

## Project background
- SARS-CoV-2 emerged at the end of 2019 as the cause of COVID-19.
- High infectivity has resulted in a still ongoing pandemic.
- There is no current treatment.
- **Currently only little knowledge about the effect of COVID-19 infection on host cell gene expression.**


## Project Aim



*Aim: To carry out tidy data analysis of proteomics data, and communicate the findings to non-bioinformaticians in a way that enables them to get information about their genes of choice.*


# Materials

## Project data

- Data obtained from Bojkova *et al.*
- Infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 using a human cell-culture model.
  - Infection (**Corona**) or **mock**-infection of **Caco-2** (colon epithilial carcinoma cells)


## Project Data

- Protein expression at **four different time** points.
- For each time point we have **triplicates**
- Cells lysed and lysate fed into **LC-MS/MS** to generate **protein counts**. 


## Project Data
- Investigate genes and pathways that are altered during infection.
- Dataset consisting of two files to be joined and cleaned:
  - **Gene counts** and **sample meta-information**.  


# Methods

## Methods

- Everything done in **Tidyverse** R. 
- Done through **Github** to emphasize project collaboration

## Project overview

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/flowchart.png")
```

## Handling zeros

- Replace with a **small value**. 
- An inherent problem for -omics and when handling compositional data in general.


## Data augmentation

- After cleaning data was **normalized**
- Normalization is due to different samplesizes
- **FPKM** equivalent **not feasible**
  - **Big genes** are not necessarily translated more 
- On data frame iskept that has **ALL** the replicate information

## Data augmentation

- We calculated **means** for **conditions** over **replicates**. 
- Since this is **loss** of information we saved new data tibble


## Data augmentation

- We used the triplicate means to calculate a **Log fold change**
- Log fold change was calculated between **treatment** at the different **timepoints**
- Saved a **new data frame**


## Exploratory Analysis

- **PCA** was performed to check for groupings in the normalized **count** data
- K-means to see if any particular **grouping** showed up
- A **heatmap** was also constructed to look for gene clusters with similar expression


## Exploratory Analysis

- The **LogFC** the top 20 and top 8 **DE** genes were found


## Modelling

- **Linear models** were used to test:
  - Does **logFC** of genes change significantly **over time**
  - Do we see significant **differences** between **Counts** at individual **time points**


# Results

```

## Top downregulated DE-genes

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_bottom_8_over_time.png")
```

## Shiny app
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_app("https://signe-hjort.shinyapps.io/shiny/", height = "500px")
```


## Project overview and structure
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/flowchart.png")
```


# Discussion


## Results

- A lot of the upregulated genes are in the corona genome
- Good sanity check
