# Introduction

## Project background
- SARS-CoV-2 emerged at the end of 2019 as the cause of COVID-19.
- High infectivity has resulted in a still ongoing pandemic.
- There is no current treatment.
- **Currently only little knowledge about the effect of COVID-19 infection on host cell gene expression.**


## Project Aim
*Aim: To carry out tidy data analysis of proteomics data, and communicate the findings to non-bioinformaticians in a way that enables them to get information about their genes of choice.*


# Materials

## Project data
- Data obtained from Bojkova *et al.*.
- Infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 using a human cell-culture model.
  - Infection or mock-infection of Caco-2 (colon epithilial carcinoma cells)
---
- Protein expression at four different time points after infection.
- Investigate genes and pathways that are altered during infection.
- Tandem MS generated protein counts
- Dataset consisting of two files to be joined: Gene counts and sample information.  


# Methods

## Project overview
```{r}
include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/flowchart.png")
```


## Data augmentation
- Normalize mean within each group of replicates.
- Mean of replicates
- Log2 fold change between control and infected samples
- Output saved in three files

## heatmap
## top expression
## PCA
## Kmeans







## Analysis

### Log2 fold change
- Log2 fold change
- Top and bottom differentially expressed genes

- Maybe also some focus on why we chose to do so many different scripts for the plots




## Modelling


# Results
## PCA
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "1000px",}
#knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_PCA_plot.png")
```
---

## Heatmap
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "1000px",}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_Heatmap.png")
```



## Shiny app
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_app("https://signe-hjort.shinyapps.io/shiny/", height = "500px")
```


## Project overview and structure
```{r}

```


# Discussion
* genes for further
* Benefit if had done gene ontology  ??
