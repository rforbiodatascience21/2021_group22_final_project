# Introduction

## Project background
- SARS-CoV-2 emerged at the end of 2019 as the cause of COVID-19.
- High infectivity has resulted in a still ongoing pandemic.
- There is no current treatment.

- To investigate the infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 Bojkova et al used a human cell-culture model. They infected the cells with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 and looked at protein expression at four different time points after infection.


## Project data and aim
*Aim: To analyse proteomics data and communicate the findings to non-bioinformaticians in a way that enables them to get information about their genes of choice.  *

- Data from 
  - Use proteomics to get a profile of the host cell response to infection with SARS-CoV-2.
  - Determine genes and pathways that are altered during infection.
  

## Project overview and structure
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "650px",}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_PCA_plot.png")
```
**insert picture of structure**

# Materials and methods

## Data cleaning
- Dataset consisting of two files to be joined: Gene counts and sample information.  
- Prepare datasets for joining:  
  - Remove unwanted columns.  
  - Replace zeroes with very low values.
  - Rename variables.
- inner_join()

## Data augmentation
- Find and normalize mean within each group of replicates.
- Find log2 fold change


## Exploratory data analysis
- Maybe also some focus on why we chose to do so many different scripts for the plots

## Modelling


# Results
## PCA
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "650px",}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_PCA_plot.png")
```
---

## Heatmap
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "650px",}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/04_Heatmap.png")
```



## Shiny app
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_app("URL", height = "500px")
```


# Discussion

* Benefit if had done gene ontology  ??
